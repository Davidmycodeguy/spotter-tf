Dockerfile which is used to build an image for a containerized application. The instructions in the Dockerfile will be executed in the order they are written.
1. The first instruction FROM node:16-alpine specifies the base image for the container. In this case, it is using the "node:16-alpine" image, which is a minimal Alpine Linux image with Node.js version 16 installed.
2. The instruction WORKDIR /app sets the working directory for the remaining instructions in the Dockerfile to the "/app" directory in the container.
3. The instruction COPY package.json yarn.lock ./ copies the "package.json" and "yarn.lock" files from the build context (the directory where the Dockerfile is located) to the working directory in the container.
4. The instruction RUN yarn runs the yarn package manager to install the dependencies specified in the "package.json" file.
5. The instruction RUN npm i --force runs npm package manager to install the dependencies specified in the "package.json" file. It uses --force flag because it will install the missing or invalid dependencies.
6. The instruction COPY . . copies the remaining files from the build context to the working directory in the container.
7. The instruction EXPOSE 5173 tells the container to listen on port 5173.
8. The instruction CMD [ "yarn","dev", "--host" ] sets the command that will be run when the container is started. In this case, it runs the "yarn" command with "dev" and "--host" arguments.
Once the image is built, it can be run as a container, and the application will be available on port 5173. And, the command yarn dev --host will run the development server of the application with the host flag.
