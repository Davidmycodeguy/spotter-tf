Terraform script that creates resources for an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster and task definitions for the frontend and backend services.
1. The first line provider "aws" { region = var.region } sets the AWS provider for Terraform and sets the region for all the resources that will be created. The var.region is a variable that can be defined in a separate file and passed to the script.
2. The next block module "vpc" creates a virtual private cloud (VPC) using the module/vpc source. It passes several variables such as vpc_cidr, name, env, public_subnets_cidr, private_subnets_cidr, availability_zones and name_of_security_group to the VPC module.
3. The next block module "ecs" creates an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster using the module/ecs source. It passes several variables such as vpc_id, ecr_repo_name, loadbalancer_sg, public_subnets, target_group_name, load_balancer_name, task_definition_name, containername, container_port, host_port, td_memory, td_cpu, container_memory, container_cpu, ecs_cluster_name, ecs_service_name, ECS_sg, and private_subnets to the ECS module.
4. The next block module "backend-ecs" creates an ECS service for the backend service using the module/backend-ecs source. It passes several variables such as vpc_id, ecr_repo_name, loadbalancer_sg, public_subnets, target_group_name, load_balancer_name, task_definition_name, containername, container_port, host_port, td_memory, td_cpu, container_memory, container_cpu, ecs_cluster_name, ecs_service_name, ECS_sg, and private_subnets to the ECS service module.
This script creates a VPC, an ECS cluster and ECS service for both frontend and backend services. It also creates an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storing, managing and deploying container images, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and target groups for the frontend and backend services. It uses different modules for different resources and passes variables to those modules. Also, it uses different variables for different resources like ecr_repo_name, target_group_name, load_balancer_name, task_definition_name, containername, container_port, host_port, td_memory, td_cpu, container_memory, container_cpu, ecs_cluster_name, ecs_service_name.
